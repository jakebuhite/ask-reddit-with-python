I made Jim Lahey's no knead bread recipe today with about 2/3 fresh-milled, it tastes amazing and has pretty good structure inside, but is definitely not as tall as it is when I only use AP, so I'm going to try adding VWG next time and see what happens.
You can start easily by throwing a roasted chicken carcass, a quartered onion, a carrot, a celery stalk, and a couple cloves of garlic into a pot that just fits them, cover with water, and simmer until it smells amazing.
The day I’m going to make bread, I take the starter out of the fridge, “feed” it with 100g warm water and 100g flour, and leave it on the counter for a couple of hours or until it is good and bubbly and has risen well.
Soft (not crunchy) but firm crust and delicate texture inside are achieved by putting the formed "dough ring" into boiling water for a few seconds immediately before baking it.
With the addition of a dash of "bread spice" (ground caraway, coriander and onion powder), you don't really taste the chocolate or coffee, per se, but get deep roasted, earthy, slightly bitter note that adds to the sourdough from the levain.
Caramelized sugar is added to the rye sour dough and the loaf is baked for 4 hours.I make dark bread all the time using spent grain from home brewing.
